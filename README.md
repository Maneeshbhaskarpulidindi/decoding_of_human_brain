# EEG Classification Project Documentation

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify EEG signals using various deep learning architectures, enhancing the understanding of brain activity patterns. We implemented multiple models, including CNN-LSTM hybrids and encoder-based architectures, to achieve improved classification accuracy.

## Expected Outcomes
1. **Improved Classification Accuracy**: Our current model achieves ~45% accuracy in classifying EEG signals, and we aim to increase it to >80% by refining the CNN-LSTM hybrid model for spatial and temporal pattern recognition.
  
2. **Enhanced Feature Representation**: Using Temporal, spatial, and residual blocks of the encoder architecture,capture refined features from EEG signals, leading to a better understanding of brain activity patterns.

3. **Model Performance Comparison**: Through implementing LSTM-CNN,CNN1D-LSTM, CNN2D-LSTM, deep CNN, and Encoder-based architectures, we compare and identify the most effective approach, with CNN-LSTM showing promising results.

4. **EEG-based Image Generation**: Leveraging SNGANs, we aim to generate images from classified EEG signals, bridging brain activity and visual stimuli.

5. **Advancement in BCI Technology**: Our study contributes to the future of brain-computer interfaces, enhancing EEG signal decoding and visual stimulus reconstruction.

## Future Work
We plan to focus on the following areas to further improve our project:
- **Increasing Accuracy**: Our target is to enhance the classification accuracy to >80% by refining our models and optimizing hyperparameters.
- **Generating Images**: We will explore advanced techniques to generate images from classified EEG signals, utilizing SNGANs for effective visual representation.
